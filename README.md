This repository includes all scripts used in Koven et al., "Much of Zero Emissions Commitment Occurs Before Reaching Net Zero Emissions", https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acab1a, to define the scenario, run the CESM2 experiment, analyze the results of the CESM2 experiment, run and analyze the FaIR perturbed parameter ensemble, and analyze CMIP6 CDRMIP data.

The results of the emissions-forced CESM2 experiment, including the concatenated files used in the notebook `EDCDR_notebook.ipynb` as well as the complete set of CESM2 output are archived and available at https://portal.nersc.gov/archive/home/c/cdkoven/www/idealized_emissdriven_cdr_cesm2
